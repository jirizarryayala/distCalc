distCalc 0.1.0 Help
Functions:
preprocess-takes a .mzML file and outputs a preprocessed verion.

distCalc-internal function for distComp.

distComp-takes one, two or three .mzML files and calculates the monoisotopic distribution of the same envelope in all of them.
Notes:
-Also requires mzr, charge state, and Sprectrum Index(see findSpecIndex) for the envelope of interest of the first file.
-The output for this function is a distribution class object(when one file is the input), or lists with distribution class objects(when more than one file is the input.)

findSpecIndex-Given a preprocessed .mzML file and a Scan Number returns Spectrum Index.

distWrite-given a distribution class object and an output path writes a .txt file with that distribution's data frame and weighted average mass.
